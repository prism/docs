# /pr teleport

<Command command="teleport (activity id)" alias="tp" />

Teleports you to the world and location of the specific activity id.

Activity IDs can be found by doing a `--nogroup` lookup.

<Command command="teleport loc (player name) (world name) (x) (y) (z)" />

Teleports the player to the world/location. Amazingly this doesn't exist as a native command.
