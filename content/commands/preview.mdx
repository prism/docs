# /pr preview

Preview commands will allow you to view block changes without actually changing the world on the server.

It works by telling your game client the blocks changed, just not the server. 

<Callout type='info'>Because of how Minecraft works, previews will **only** include block changes. Entities and items cannot be "faked".</Callout>

<Command command="preview-rollback" alias="prb" />

The preview rollback command will preview any reversible changes based on your search parameters.

To understand the parameters available and their use, please see [Parameters](/parameters).

<Command command="preview-restore" alias="prs" />

Preview support for restores is unfinished.

<Command command="preview-apply" />

Applying a preview will perform the actual rollback/restore, altering the server world.

<Command command="preview-cancel" />

Canceling a preview will send the "live" block data to your client and discard the queued modifications.
