<Command command='vault (parameters)' alias='v' />

Items are frequently too complex to represent in chat.

The **Vault** will show you a virtual inventory of items found in the parameter query.

The vault command only accepts `action` parameters for item action types, such as `item-drop`, `item-remove`, etc.

If there are many items found, you can view additional "pages" by clicking the "Next Page" paper button in the bottom row of the inventory.

## Reversing

By removing an item from the vault, you're effectively reversing the action. When you close the inventory the action will be marked `reversed` just like a rollback.

Removing items from the vault will also be logged to your server's log file.
