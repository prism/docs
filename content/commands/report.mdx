# /pr report

## Modification Queue Report

<Command command="report modification-queue" />

Displays current statistics about the modification queue.

## Partial Modifications Report

<Command command="report partial" />

When performing a rollback/restore modification, you may see a message that some activities were partially applied.

Either by clicking on that value or by running this report command, you can see a more detailed explanation about why a change was partially applied.

For example, if you rollback cobble formed from lava, the cobble needs to be removed but the lava is blacklisted by default and should not be restored.

This leads to a partial modification.

### Partial Application Reasons

* Blacklisted - The block/entity/item was blacklisted in your configuration. TNT for example.

## Skipped Modification Report

<Command command="report skips" />

When performing a rollback/restore modification, you may see a message that some activities were skipped.

Either by clicking on that value or by running this report command, you can see a more detailed explanation about why a change was skipped.

### Skip Reasons

* Already Set - The block is already set and the modification is not necessary.
* Not Applicable - The modification isn't applicable due to a very specific scenario.
* Not Implemented - The activity has no rollback/restore support.
