<Command command="report skips" />

When performing a rollback/restore modification, you may see a message that some activities were skipped.

## Skip Reasons

* Already Set - The block is already set and the modification is not necessary.
* Blacklisted - The block/entity/item was blacklisted in your configuration. TNT for example.
* Not Applicable - The modification isn't applicable due to a very specific scenario.
* Not Implemented - The activity has no rollback/restore support.
