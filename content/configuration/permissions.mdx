# Permissions

We recommend these permissions for server staff:

- `prism.extinguish` - Use the extinguish command to put out fires.
- `prism.help` - Show help info and `/prism about` messaging.
- `prism.lookup` - Use the lookup, near, peek commands, and the inspection wand.
- `prism.inspect` - Use the inspection wand, regardless of lookup permissions.
- `prism.modify` - Preview and perform rollbacks/restores, previews, and use related wands.
- `prism.alerts.receive` - Receive block/item alerts.
- `prism.alerts.bypass` - Do not trigger alerts (knowing how big the vein you found is fun, but maybe unfair...).

We recommend these permission for server administrators:

- `prism.admin` - Administration commands like config reload, queue management.
- `prism.purge` - Trigger database purges manually.
