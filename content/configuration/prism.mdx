# prism.conf

The `prism.conf` configuration file is the main configuration file.

The files are well-commented with explanations so we won't duplicate that here.

Prism ships with sensible defaults, and some of the options in the file are things you likely never need to change.

However, here are some things you should definitely be aware of:

- `actions` - Disable anything unimportant you. The fewer actions logged can save space in the database.
- `debug` - We may ask you to enable this and send us the logs when getting support.
- `filter_debug` - This can be helpful in debugging your filters. It can get spammy, so do it on a test server.
- `purges` - Schedule one purge rule to clean out old data.
