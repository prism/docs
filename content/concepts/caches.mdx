# Caches

Prism caches data to reduce expensive operations, keep data available for a short time, and to avoid network requests.

This process should ideally be transparent to you, but if you have needs to change the cache values they can be adjusted in the configuration file.

Also see the [Cache Command](/commands/cache).
