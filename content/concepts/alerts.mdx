# Alerts

Alerts notify staff (or anyone with the `prism.alerts.receive` permission) of certain events in the game.

Alerts can be enabled/disabled, allow custom colors, lists of materials, etc.

You can configure them to apply only to non-creative gamemodes, and they will ignore anyone with the `prism.alerts.bypass` permission.

## Block Break

Block break alerts are primarily intended for use with mining. They alert receivers when a player breaks a specific block,
and includes the light level and whether the player had night vision.

## Block Place

Block place alerts trigger when a player places a configured block.

For example, `tnt` triggers an alert when a player places TNT.

## Item Use

Item use alerts trigger when a player right clicks on a block with a configured item.

For example `flint_and_steel` triggers an alert when a player tries to light a fire.
