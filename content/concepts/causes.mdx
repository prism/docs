# Cause and (A)ffect

Prism distinctly captures both a _cause_ and _affected_ object with most activities (some are purely informational, and only have a cause, like player-join etc).

A "cause" can be a player, block, entity, or generically-named concept.

An affected object can be a player, block, entity, or item.

Examples:

- Player - "viveleroi broke Dirt"
- Block - "Fire burned Oak Log"
- Entity - "Sheep ate Grass"
- Named Cause - "gravity broke sand"

## Parameters

To give you more control over what you're looking for, player, block, and entity parameters have variants to specify cause or affected.

[block](/parameters/b) and [entity](/parameters/e) parameters search for _affected_ blocks/entities.

To look exclusively for activities they _caused_, use [block cause](/parameters/bc) or [entity cause](/parameters/ec) parameters.

The [player parameter](/parameters/p) always searched for both, so for consistency it has remained. It really only impacts player death and maybe a few other events, and there's realistically no difference.

To search only for player's as the cause (for example, the killer), use [pc](/parameters/pc).

To search only for player's affected (for example, the victim), use [pa](/parameters/pa).
