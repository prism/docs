# Troubleshooting

## Databases

Database servers can involve a learning curve if you're new to them.

If Prism fails to connect to your database, we can't usually help because the details are specific to your setup.

**Please do NOT post your database credentials in discord or on github.**

If you're using a hosting company, you should be able to get support regarding database setup and connection problems.

If you encounter issues with the database connection (mysql/maria/postgres only), check the following:

- Check the logs for any errors or warnings. Confirm the error is database-related. Prism should say so.
- Confirm the database address and your credentials were entered correctly.
- Ensure the database server is running.
- Try logging in to your database using another tool.
- Check the firewall settings.
- Confirm the versions match our requirements.
- Enable `debug` mode in prism.conf and [send us the log](https://mclo.gs/) for support.
