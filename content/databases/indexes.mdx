# Indexes

Databases uses indexes to efficiently search for data. An index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations. Indexes are created on one or more columns of a table, allowing the database to quickly locate rows based on the values in those columns.

Prism's default indexes are designed off the default parameters and assumed common queries.

If you're seeing slow queries, you may need to create or modify the indexes to suit your needs.

Indexes should match the type of queries you run most often.

# Spy and EXPLAIN

In the `storage.conf` file, enabled the `spy` setting and run a typical lookup command in-game.

The spy system will log the SQL query to the console/log, both with a parameterized and value-filled version.

Use the value-filled version along with the `EXPLAIN` sql syntax to examine which indexes the query is using.
