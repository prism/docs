# Updating

Updating Prism is straightforward, but it's important to follow the correct steps to ensure a smooth transition.

## Releases

Releases are intended to be stable and are suitable for production use. 

<Steps>

### Configuration Files

Additions to the configuration files will automatically appear. Changes will not, but these will be rare and should only ever occur in major version changes.

### Database Updates
 
Any database changes should be applied automatically when you start the server. However, schema changes on existing databases with a lot of data may take time. We'll try to indicate any releases with schema changes in the release notes, so you can try to plan ahead.

### "libs" Folder
 
If Prism uses a new/updated library it will automatically download that file into the `libs` folder.

Release versions should never _require_ you to delete the `libs` folder, but currently Prism will not delete previous library jar files, so it can be beneficial to file cleanliness to delete the folder every update.

### "locales" Folder

New entries into locales files should be automatic. Changes to existing entries are not. If in-game messages aren't working correctly, you may need to deleted the `locales` folder and restart the server.

</Steps>

## Betas/Dev Builds

Betas and dev builds assume the database and files are temporary.

You may need to delete the database, `locales`, and `libs` folder with every update.

## Versioning

Prism uses a version numbering scheme of `major.minor.patch` (e.g., `1.2.3`).

When the major version changes, like 3 -> 4, it indicates a breaking change. 

When the minor version changes, like 4.1 -> 4.2, it indicates new features or improvements that are backward compatible. 

The patch version is for bug fixes and does not introduce new features.
