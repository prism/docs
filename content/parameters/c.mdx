# Causes

Use the `c:[causename]` parameter to search for activities with a named cause.

A named cause is something that wasn't a player, block, or entity - like "gravity".

Players, blocks, and entities are special kinds of causes.

To search for player-caused activities see [player](./p) or [player cause](./pc).

To search for block-caused activities see [block cause](./bc).

To search for entity-caused activities see [block cause](./ec).
