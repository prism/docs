# Basics

Parameters are optional ways to filter query results. They're the same for lookups, rollbacks, restores, previews, and purges.

They are always entered after the command you're using. For example `/pr lookup a:break p:viveleroi`.

If no parameters are provided, Prism will use any configured defaults.

Parameters act as an "AND" condition, but parameters that support multiple entries act as an "OR". You may need to run multiple commands if your parameters might conflict. For example `p:viveleroi m:stone e:cow` will return "No Results" because there's no way all three values can exist in a single record.

However, a single parameter that accepts multiple entries will work as expected. `p:kermit,fozzie m:stone` will find records in which kermit **or** fozzie acted upon stone.
