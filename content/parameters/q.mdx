# Query

Use the `q:` parameter to perfect a text-search on activity "descriptors".

- `q:[keyword]`

Sometimes, activities aren't tied to a known player/block/etc, so the descriptor may include information you want to query.

It's also a partial text search, so it's forgiving if you don't know the exact data.
