# Query

Use the `descriptor:` parameter to perform a text-search on activity "descriptors".

- `descriptor:[keyword]`

Sometimes, activities aren't tied to a known player/block/etc, so the descriptor may include information you want to query.

It's also a partial text search, so it's forgiving if you don't know the exact data.

Since the causes update in beta 2, the descriptor field is used sparingly. Descriptors are often used for items, since they often include details not easily translated like custom names.
