# Entity Type Tags

Use the `etag:[entity type tag]` parameter to more efficiently search for entities included in the tag.

Tags are a Minecraft concept for organizing blocks, items, and entities into groups. There are quite a lot already defined in Minecraft but you can also create your own via datapacks.

For example, `etag:minecraft:aquatic` would search for any aquatic mobs. [See the full list](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Entity_type_tag_(Java_Edition)).

You can even supply multiple tags, like `etag:minecraft:aquatic,minecraft:boat`.

Defining your own tags would be an extremely powerful way to group entity types.
