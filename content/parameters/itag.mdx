# Item Tags

Use the `itag:[items tag]` parameter to more efficiently search for materials included in the tag.

Tags are a Minecraft concept for organizing blocks, items, and entities into groups. There are quite a lot already defined in Minecraft but you can also create your own via datapacks.

For example, `itag:minecraft:pickaxes` would search for any pickaxes. [See the full list](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Item_tag_(Java_Edition)).

You can even supply multiple tags, like `itag:minecraft:planks,minecraft:logs`.

Defining your own tags would be an extremely powerful way to group materials.
