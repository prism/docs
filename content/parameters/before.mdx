# Before

Use the `before:[time code]` parameter to confine the search to activities that occured before the given time.

For example, `before:3d` would include records logged before three days ago. More recent records would be excluded. 

For help with time codes, see [Timecodes](/misc/timecodes).

Also see [since](./since).
