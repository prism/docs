# Causes

Use the `cause:[causename]` parameter to search for activities with a specific non-player cause.

"Causes" are names of any non-player "actor" that initiated an activity.

For example when axolotls kill glow squid, the `entity` is `glow_squid` and the `cause` is `axolotl`.

A search for `cause:axolotl` will return mobs killed by an axolotl.

A search for `cause:lava` will return a lot of bat deaths.

"Cause Names" will usually be block or entity names, or "environment", but may include other things.

Players are a special kind of cause. To search for player-caused activities see [player](./player).
