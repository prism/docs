# Bounds

Use the `bounds:[minX],[minY],[minZ]/[maxX],[maxY],[maxZ]` parameter to search within a rectangular region, defined by a "min" and "max" coordinate (a.k.a. the corners of a box).

For example, `bounds:0,0,0/10,10,10` would search exclusively for activities within a rectangle starting at `0,0,0` and ending at `10,10,10`.
