# Since

Use the `since:[time code]` parameter to confine the search to activities that occured after the given time.

For example, `since:1h` would include records logged after one hour ago. Older records would be excluded.

For help with time codes, see [Timecodes](/misc/timecodes).

Also see [before](./before).
