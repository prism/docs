# Block Tags

Use the `btag:[blocks tag]` parameter to more efficiently search for materials included in the tag.

Tags are a Minecraft concept for organizing blocks, items, and entities into groups. There are quite a lot already defined in Minecraft but you can also create your own via datapacks.

For example, `btag:minecraft:dirt` would search for any dirt-like materials including `dirt`, `coarse_dirt`, and `podzol`. [See the full list](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Block_tag_(Java_Edition)).

You can even supply multiple tags, like `btag:minecraft:corals,minecraft:coral_blocks,minecraft:coral_plants`.

Defining your own tags would be an extremely powerful way to group materials.
