# At

Use the `at:[x],[y],[z]` parameter to confine or center the search on a single coordinate.

For example, `at:0,0,0` by itself would search exclusively for activities affecting that single block. 

If used with [radius](./r), [in](./in), and [world](./world) parameters, `at` will become the origin coordinate instead of your current location.
