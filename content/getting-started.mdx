## Installation

1. Put the prism-*.jar file into your `plugins` folder.
2. Install [NBT-API](https://modrinth.com/plugin/nbtapi) into your plugins folder.
3. _Optionally_ install [WorldEdit](https://modrinth.com/plugin/nbtapi>) for region selection support.
4. Start your server once to generate configs.
5. Configure the plugin as needed.

## Recommendations

**Prevention** is the first step in protecting your server. There's no need for lookups and rollbacks if players can protect their land.
