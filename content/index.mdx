## 4 > 3

Prism version 4 is a **complete** rewrite. We're retiring the original Prism codebase which started in 2012.

This new version aims to correct all of the problems with the old product including saner permissions, better database support, better configuration, better logging, better rollbacks... you know what, just _better everything_.

### Upgrading

Unfortunately there is no way to upgrade from Prism 3. Prism 4 needs a clean start.
