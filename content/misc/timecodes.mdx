# Timecodes

Prism uses a user-friendly shorthand to define a point in time. Timecodes can be used individually or combined.

The available time codes are always in the format `[number][unit]`:

- `s` = second
- `m` = minute
- `h` = hour
- `d` = day
- `w` = week

Example timecodes:

- `3w` = 3 weeks
- `1h30m` = 1 hour, 30 minutes (`90m` also works)
- `1d12h` = 1 day, 12 hours

These can be used in any parameter which supports timecodes.
