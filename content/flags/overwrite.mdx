# Overwrite

Prism will skip modifying blocks if they are already set to the same material and block data. 

Prism assumes the block has already been rolled back/restored and won't do it again because it could damage subsequent intentional changes or cause odd break logic especially with double-length blocks like doors.

Use the `--overwrite` (alias `-ow`) flag to set blocks no matter what.
